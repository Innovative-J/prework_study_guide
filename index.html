      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
        <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website</li>
        <li>The reason the instructions (above) place the script element near the bottom of the HTML file is that the
          browser reads code in the order it appears in the file.</li>
        <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
        <li> String - This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in
          single or double quote marks.</li>
        <li>Number - This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
        <li>Boolean This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote
          marks.</li>
        <li>Array - This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
        <li>Object - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep
          this in mind as you learn.</li>
        <li>Not, Does-not-equal - equal This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true
          into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two
          values are not equal. ex ! , !==</li>
        <li>Strict Equality - This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns
          a true/false (Boolean) result. ex ===</li>
        <li>Assignment - As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable. ex =</li>
        <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of
          conditionals is the if...else statement</li>
        <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of
          code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code</li>
        <li>Events - Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for
          activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which
          is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. </li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
